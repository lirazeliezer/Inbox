Make sure you have Node.JS installed: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Clone the git repository

client side-
run npm install -g local-web-server inside the repo directory
$ cd <your-app-folder>
$ ws
open the browser in http://localhost:8000/ and check the app :)

* the app reflacts a situation where a user has already loged in and
 messages.json contains email messages of that specific user (instead of getting the data from a DB)
